# Last Epoch Item Filter CLI

This may or not be something useful for the multiplayer patch.

TL;DR: I am trying to figure out how to make a proper filter for me and my friends.

# Example 

**Usage**
> java -jar leitemfilter-cli-*.*.jar -cf player1,player2-o multiplayer

*Example filters and the result can be found under releases*
